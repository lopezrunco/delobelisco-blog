        description: "There's a year since I arrived to India and the people still asking me to define this country with one word, which is complicated, but I think the word is INTENSE. All is intense: the food, the smell, the transit and yes, the indian people could be intense too. \n \n Since I got out of the plane in February 2022, I felt an unique smell that I never smelt before, then, in the streets I felt a thousand more: the spices, the food, the polution, the animals, etc. It was the first time in my life I really saw an over populated country with its consecuences, Delhi is literally a sea of people, noises and animals (that doesn't say you won't find quite places in this country). \n \n India is tourism: The number of places to do sightseeing is huge, you will never get bored of seeing things. In Delhi, you can call a rickshaw and in 10 minutes you will found an intereseting place to see: a park (they love to enjoy the parks doing pic nic and all kind of games), an acient building, a temple, a mosque or a mausoleum. But of course, we had to take some preacautions to travel, for example: never drink water from the faucet, be careful with the food we eat, be aware of the scammers (specially in the stations), check the weather before go out (between July and August could be temperatures of 48 C°). \n The first place where I went was the Taj Mahal. Just wonderfull. There are few buildings that evoke such a depth of feeling. Built as an expression of the love that Shah Jahan held for his second wife, Mumptaz Mahal, the beauty of the mausoleum has withstood time and is a true wonder. The best months to go are October, November, February and March. Any other season of the year is too hot, too crowdy, too foggy or too contaminated. \n Then it was the turn of the desert, we went to Jaisalmer, 860 km close to the border with Pakistan. This city has a history of culture and archaeology which spans thousands of years. In Jaisalmer, the climate is arid, which implies that the days are hot while the nights are cold. Winter, which begins from mid October to early March, is the best time to visit Jaisalmer. \n Then, we went to the north, to Manali. Manali is an ideal honeymoon destination. Surrounded by snow covered peaks round the year, it offers a scenic view. River Beas that flows through Manali adds to the beauty. Rohtang pass/Rohtang and Solang Valley are worth going. These places have good adventure sports like skiing, rafting, paragliding, snow scooters etc. \n At this point, I was amazed with all the touristic places that India offers, but that was just the beginning: In the next months we travel to the marvelous Elephanta Caves in Mumbai. Then Udaipur, reckoned as one of the best holiday destinations in India, a city replete with splendid architectures. Also the Ranakpur Jain Temple, an absolutely mesmerising place surrounded by woods with an incredible marble work that has no parallel to what once sees in the rest of Rajasthan. Then Hampi, the city of ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And this is only a fraction of the history and culture that India offers. \n \n The bad experiences in India are mainly related with overpopulation and the contamination: \n My first impression of the transit was CHAOS. The indian people use the honk a lot, so the city is very noisy, they have no preference in the roundabouts, no yields, there's people driving in the wrong way, they park the cars over the sidewalk so the peatons have to walk in the street and a lot of times, you find people sleeping in the sidewalk. \n After Diwali, in October, it starts the polution in Delhi. You can smell it and see it, it's like a gray foggy curtain in the horizont. In the next months the situation is worst, you start to feel a dirty in your eyes and your throat. Some of the people living in Delhi are very used to the polution, others say that the air makes them get sick. Every year is the same, in the first months of winter the city is covered by a polution cloud. The smoke of Diwali's fireworks, the smoke of the cars, the industrial waste and the farmers burning crop residues near the city are the main causes of the polution. Every year the goberment talk about new ways to control it but every year the polution is getting worst.  \n \n You could love or hate India, you will se the best and the worst of the human being, you will see, hear and smell unique things. Whatever your feelings are about this country, I'm sure of one thing: you'll not get bored.",

        description: 'Since I was old enough to hold a pencil I was drawing every day. Drawing has always helped me to express myself, and to manage myself in this ever-changing world. I take inspiration from many places: books, nightmares, books, movies, art, etc. \n No matter what age you are, or what level your artistic skills are at, drawing can help improve so many aspects of your life. \n \n Though there are many different ways to stimulate your brain, drawing is a very effective method for activating multiple parts of your brain at once. Studies have shown an overall increase in gray matter in the brains of people who regularly engage in artistic hobbies or careers. This means that drawing regularly will help you keep your brain healthy and growing gray matter. \n \n Creating art requires you to use your imagination efficiently. By using your imagination to come up with ideas, you improve your ability to visualize and process your own inner thoughts. Drawing enables you to express these inner concepts visually and continue developing your creativity. \n \n Engaging in drawing or other artistic activities can help to improve your recollection skills. Drawing forces us to utilize our "mental storage" skills to recall a range of techniques and artistic knowledge. Subconsciously, this process of revisiting our visual library and artistic imagination helps our brain strengthen its ability to remember things. \n \n Drawing can provide you with the escapism needed to mentally remove yourself from the stress of everyday life. Releasing your daily stress through creativity is a great way to boost your mental health, as well as to help manage mental illnesses. Creativity is very effective for this purpose as it requires you to focus fully on your project, rather than letting your brain run wild with anxious thoughts. \n \n Artists in general are known for being quite observant of their surroundings. This is because individuals who study artistic techniques are more likely to have an understanding and interest in lighting, shading, color, and many other aspects foundational to drawing. These factors train your brain to focus on the intricacies of ordinary things you see throughout the day. By being more observant, you also improve your ability to focus. \n \n One of the best things about drawing is that you do not need to be a professional artist to gain all of these amazing benefits. All you have to do is take some time out of your day to relax and enjoy being creative. When it comes to drawing, the possibilities of what you can do are truly endless. \n There is no right or wrong way to be creative.',
